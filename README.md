# Scrap.tf-RaffleBot

A bot that enters raffles on Scrap.tf automaticly.

Selenium is used to fetch the login cookies.

Chromium and it's Webdriver are downloaded automatically if not already present.

After the login is made the raffles are entered using requests.

---

## Danger
Using any tool that automates raffle entering is forbidden.
I don't assume responsibility if your account gets banned for using this tool.

---

### Requirements
 
 1. A Windows/Linux machine.
 3. Python 3.8 or later
 4. Selenium, bs4 and requests
	You can install them using "pip install selenium" and "pip install bs4" and "pip install requests"

---

### Instructions

 1. Run the script rafflebot.py
 2. If this is the first time running it you will need to create a login cookie.
 3. In order to create the cookie log into your 'scrap.tf' account, write "ready" in terminal after that.
 4. Enjoy :)
